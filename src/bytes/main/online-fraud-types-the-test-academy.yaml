      Card Testing Fraud involves the use of stolen credit card numbers to make
      small test purchases on an e-commerce site. Once the fraudster confirms
      that a card number works, they proceed to make larger purchases. Friendly
      Fraud involves a consumer buying a product or service online, claiming the
      transaction was invalid, and requesting a chargeback from their processor.

      Refund Fraud occurs when a stolen credit card is used for a transaction,
      and the scammer then requests a refund due to an unintentional
      overpayment. Account Takeover Fraud involves gaining access to a user's
      account on an e-commerce site, often through stolen passwords or phishing
      operations, and engaging in fraudulent activity.

      Interception Fraud involves fraudsters placing orders with stolen credit
      card information, then attempting to intercept the package before it
      reaches the intended recipient. Triangulation Fraud involves a fraudster
      setting up a fake storefront, attracting customers with low prices, and
      then using stolen credit card information to order goods from legitimate
      e-commerce sites.
