      **Governor proposal creation may be blocked by frontrunning**


      ## Issue Impact


      *By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the
      proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this
      repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This
      impacts the Governor contract in v4.9.0 only, and the
      GovernorCompatibilityBravo contract since v4.3.0.*

      **TransparentUpgradeableProxy clashing selector calls may not be
      delegated**
    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact


      *A function in the implementation contract may be inaccessible if its
      selector clashes with one of the proxy's own selectors. Specifically, if
      the clashing function has a different signature with incompatible ABI
      encoding, the proxy could revert while attempting to decode the arguments
      from calldata. The probability of an accidental clash is negligible, but
      one could be caused deliberately.*

      ## Issue Fixed

      **GovernorCompatibilityBravo may trim proposal calldata**
    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact


      *The proposal creation entrypoint (propose) in GovernorCompatibilityBravo
      allows the creation of proposals with a signatures array shorter than the
      calldatas array. This causes the additional elements of the latter to be
      ignored, and if the proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would
      eventually execute without any calldata. The ProposalCreated event
      correctly represents what will eventually execute, but the proposal
      parameters as queried through getActions appear to respect the original
      intended calldata.*

      **ERC721Consecutive incorrect balance update with batch of 1**
    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact

      *The ERC721Consecutive contract designed for minting NFTs in batches does
      not update balances when a batch has size 1 and consists of a single
      token. Subsequent transfers from the receiver of that token may overflow
      the balance as reported by balanceOf.*

      **ECDSA signature malleability**
    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact

      *The functions ECDSA.recover and ECDSA.tryRecover are vulnerable to a kind
      of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in
      addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an
      issue for the functions that take a single bytes argument, and not the
      functions that take r, v, s or r, vs as separate arguments.*

      ## Issue Impact

      *Contracts using the cross chain utilies for Arbitrum L2,
      CrossChainEnabledArbitrumL2 or LibArbitrumL2, will classify direct
      interactions of externally owned accounts (EOAs) as cross chain calls,
      even though they are not started on L1. This is assessed as low severity
      because any action taken by an EOA on the contract could also be taken by
      the EOA through the bridge if the issue was not present.*

      **GovernorVotesQuorumFraction updates to quorum may affect past defeated
      proposals**
    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact

      *This issue concerns instances of Governor that use the module
      GovernorVotesQuorumFraction, a mechanism that determines quorum
      requirements as a percentage of the voting token's total supply. In
      affected instances, when a proposal is passed to lower the quorum
      requirement, past proposals may become executable if they had been
      defeated only due to lack of quorum, and the number of votes it received
      meets the new quorum requirement.*

    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact

      *The target contract of an EIP-165 supportsInterface query can cause
      unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data, while it is
      generally assumed that this operation has a bounded cost.*

      ## Issue Impact

      *SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow is not expected to revert. However,
      an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's abi.decode allows some cases
      to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-1271 as
      expected.*

      *ERC165Checker.supportsInterface is designed to always successfully return
      a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect
      assumption about Solidity 0.8's abi.decode allows some cases to revert,
      given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected,
      specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1.*

      **GovernorCompatibilityBravo incorrect ABI encoding may lead to unexpected
      behavior**
    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact

      *The GovernorCompatibilityBravo module may lead to the creation of
      governance proposals that execute function calls with incorrect arguments
      due to bad ABI encoding. This happens if the proposal is created using
      explicit function signatures, e.g. a proposal to invoke the function
      foo(uint256) is created as propose([target], [0], ["foo(uint256)"],
      ["0x00..01"]). If the function selector is provided as part of the encoded
      proposal data the issue is not present, e.g. the same proposal is created
      as propose([target], [0], ["0x2fbebd3800..01"]), where 2fbebd38 is the
      function selector. We've assessed the instances of this contract found on
      chain, and did not find any occurrence of this bug in the past. Proposal
      creation through Tally or OpenZeppelin Defender is not affected. The core
      Governor contract on its own is not affected.*

      *Initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation
      (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if
      they make an untrusted non-view external call.*

      **ERC1155Supply vulnerability in OpenZeppelin Contracts**
    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact

      *When ERC1155 tokens are minted, a callback is invoked on the receiver of
      those tokens, as required by the spec. When including the ERC1155Supply
      extension, total supply is not updated until after the callback, thus
      during the callback the reported total supply is lower than the real
      number of tokens in circulation*

      **TimelockController vulnerability in OpenZeppelin Contracts**
    fullDetails: >-
      ## Issue Impact

      *A vulnerability in TimelockController allowed an actor with the executor
      role to take immediate control of the timelock, by resetting the delay to
      0 and escalating privileges, thus gaining unrestricted access to assets
      held in the contract. Instances with the executor role set to "open" allow
      anyone to use the executor role, thus leaving the timelock at risk of
      being taken over by an attacker.*
