  - title: Compound III USDC Market on Polygon

    summary: >-
      To ensure users can avoid liquidation easily, Compound III market is being
      deployed on Polygon with USDC as the borrowable asset, and the market is
      being seeded with 500k USDC. At launch, users can use WETH, WBTC, MATIC,
      DAI, USDT, and USDC as collateral. Seeding the market with USDC will
      provide a cushion for users and create a sustainable market. Additionally,
      the proposal includes setting the pause guardian to a Gnosis multisig,
      implementing risk parameters based on recommendations from Gauntlet, and
      modestly reallocating some of the v2 USDT COMP rewards to borrowers in the
      new market.

  - title: Increase cbETH Supply Cap in cWETHv3
    uuid: fb7ebaed-52fe-411e-95e3-b00bfc149722

      Supply cap for cbETH on Comet was updated via Configurator to 30000.00 The
      motivation behind the parameter updates was to maintain the overall risk
      tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific
      assets. Gauntlet used an optimization function that balanced insolvencies,
      liquidations, and borrow usage to make parameter recommendations. Their
      simulations took into account a wide array of varied input data that
      changed on a daily basis, and the individual collateral pages on their
      dashboard covered other key statistics and outputs from their
      simulations.

  - title: Initialized cWETHv3 on Ethereum
    uuid: 5a302600-83b7-446d-b365-b7eea4ab5792
    date: '2023-01-24T05:00:00.000Z'
    summary: >-
      A second market on Ethereum Mainnet was launched, utilizing WETH as the
      base asset: cWETHv3. The market was proposed to be initialized with 2
      collateral assets: wstETH and cbETH.


      For the base asset, the ChainLink ETH/USD price feed was used, as was used
      for WETH in the cUSDCv3 market. For wstETH, a custom wrapper around the
      ChainLink stETH/USD feed was used to multiply by the wstETH/stETH exchange
      rate. This contract was in OpenZeppelin's queue for an audit. For cbETH,
      Coinbase had launched a new cbETH/USD price feed together with ChainLink.
