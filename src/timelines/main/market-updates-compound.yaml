  - title: Initialized cWETHv3 on Ethereum
    uuid: 5a302600-83b7-446d-b365-b7eea4ab5792
    date: 2023-01-24T05:00:00.000Z
    summary: >-
      A second market on Ethereum Mainnet was launched, utilizing WETH as the
      base asset: cWETHv3. The market was proposed to be initialized with 2
      collateral assets: wstETH and cbETH.


      For the base asset, the ChainLink ETH/USD price feed was used, as was used
      for WETH in the cUSDCv3 market. For wstETH, a custom wrapper around the
      ChainLink stETH/USD feed was used to multiply by the wstETH/stETH exchange
      rate. This contract was in OpenZeppelin's queue for an audit. For cbETH,
      Coinbase had launched a new cbETH/USD price feed together with ChainLink.
