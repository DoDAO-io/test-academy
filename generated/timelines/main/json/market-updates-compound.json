      "summary": "A second market on Ethereum Mainnet was launched, utilizing WETH as the base asset: cWETHv3. The market was proposed to be initialized with 2 collateral assets: wstETH and cbETH.\n\nFor the base asset, the ChainLink ETH/USD price feed was used, as was used for WETH in the cUSDCv3 market. For wstETH, a custom wrapper around the ChainLink stETH/USD feed was used to multiply by the wstETH/stETH exchange rate. This contract was in OpenZeppelin's queue for an audit. For cbETH, Coinbase had launched a new cbETH/USD price feed together with ChainLink.",
