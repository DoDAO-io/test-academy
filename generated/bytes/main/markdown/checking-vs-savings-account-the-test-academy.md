## Checking Account

A checking account is an account held at a financial institution that allows you to make credit and debit transactions. These accounts can offer both a debit card and check-writing capabilities. Withdrawals can take the form of cash withdrawals made at a branch or an automated teller machine (ATM), as well as debit card purchases, checks, money orders, ACH transfers, and wire transfers.

## Savings Account

A savings account is a deposit account that’s designed for holding funds that aren’t earmarked for everyday use, such as paying bills or spending. Banks pay savers an annual percentage yield (APY) as an incentive for depositing and keeping money in their savings accounts. Online banks often have the capability to pass on higher interest rates to savers, owing to their lower overhead and operating costs.

## Comparison

Checking accounts offer unlimited withdrawals, making them ideal for daily transactions. On the other hand, savings accounts are designed for holding funds that aren't needed for everyday use and offer higher interest rates. When choosing between the two, it's important to consider factors such as fees, minimum balance requirements, access to ATMs, and online banking tools.
