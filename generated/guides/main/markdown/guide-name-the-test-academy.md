## How Credit Companies make money

Credit card companies make money primarily through interest charges, fees charged to cardholders, and transaction fees paid by businesses that accept credit cards. When cardholders carry a balance from month to month, they are charged interest on that balance, which is a significant source of revenue for credit card issuers. Cardholders can avoid paying interest by paying their balance in full each month. 

Credit card companies also earn money from various fees. For example, some cards charge an annual fee, which is typically associated with cards that offer high rewards rates or are designed for individuals with less-than-perfect credit. Other fees include cash advance fees, balance transfer fees, and late fees. These fees can be avoided by being aware of the terms and conditions of your credit card and making timely payments.

 credit card companies earn revenue from transaction fees paid by merchants. Every time a credit card is used for a purchase, the merchant pays a processing fee to the credit card company. This fee, known as interchange, is a percentage of the transaction amount and is set by the payment networks. The more transactions that occur, the more money credit card companies make.
