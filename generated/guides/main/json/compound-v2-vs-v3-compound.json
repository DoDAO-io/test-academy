      "content": "Compound III is a refined version of the protocol that prioritizes security, capital efficiency, and user experience. Its design focuses on simplification rather than complexity, resulting in the most effective borrowing tool in DeFi.\n\nThe most significant improvement was moving away from the pooled-risk model, which allowed users to borrow any asset but constantly rehypothecated collateral. This model was vulnerable to a single bad asset or oracle update draining all assets from the protocol.\n\nIn Compound III, each market deployment offers a single borrowable asset, and the supplied collateral remains the property of the borrower, except during liquidation. This new approach increases capital efficiency and reduces risk since the collateral is more \"useful\" when the borrower knows the specific asset being borrowed in advance.\n\nThe first release of Compound III allows borrowing of USDC using ETH, WBTC, LINK, UNI, and COMP as collateral. Although borrowers will not earn interest on their collateral, they will be able to borrow more with lower risks of liquidation and penalties while spending less on gas fees.\n\nwETH market is also live now, with `Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH(cbETH)` and `Lido Staked ETH(stETH)` as collateral.\n\nThe repository uses a business source license, which Compound governance can grant usage to, as it sees fit.",

      "content": "## New Features of Compound V3\nThe major changes to the existing protocol in Compound III can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Each Compound III deployment features a single interest-earning base asset, with all other assets serving as collateral. This simplifies the protocol, reduces risk, and potentially improves capital efficiency.\n2. Collateral size limits, or supply caps, can be set for each collateral asset.\n3. Borrowing collateral factors and liquidation collateral factors are separate, protecting borrowers from early liquidation and improving risk management.\n4. The risk management and liquidation engine has been redesigned to increase the safety of the protocol while maintaining liquidator incentives.\n5. The price feed is designed to use Chainlink directly, without requiring a custom price oracle, making it portable to EVM chains beyond Ethereum. Governance retains the ability to modify this decision in the future.\n6. Supply and borrow interest rate models can be decoupled, giving governance full control over economic policy.\n7. Advanced account management tools enable new user experience patterns and applications to be built on top of the protocol.\n8. An abstract incentive metric is natively built into the core contract to reward user activity from the protocol's inception. A rewards system is also added on top to provide flexible incentives that can be extended by governance.\n9. A code repository includes sophisticated tooling for managing and testing deployments, based on years of experience and feedback from prior versions of the protocol.\n\n\n\n",
