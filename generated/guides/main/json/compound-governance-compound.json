      "content": "The goal of Compound is to create a sturdy financial infrastructure for developers and applications to rely on. To achieve this, the Compound protocol must be fully decentralized, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure (the team) and creating a robust, unbreakable system that can grow in new directions. The Compound protocol has established a governance structure that enables voters to make changes to the protocol through proposals, discussions, and executions, all without relying on or requiring a centralized team. Community governance takes the lead in this system as the administrator of the Compound protocol.\n\nWith the help of the COMP token, governance module (Governor Bravo), and Timelock, COMP token-holders govern and upgrade the Compound protocol. These three components work together to provide the community with the ability to propose, vote, and implement changes through the cToken's administrative functions or the Comptroller. These proposals can change system parameters, introduce new markets, or add new features to the protocol.\n\nThis system guarantees that the Compound protocol remains adaptive to the needs of its users and gives every COMP token holder a voice in determining the direction of the platform. If you are seeking a lending platform that places control in your hands, Compound is the perfect choice for you.\n\n\nThis \"Compound Governance\" guide serves as a comprehensive guide for those who want to contribute to the Compound DAO.  This document outlines the different responsibilities, procedures, and opportunities for all parties involved in the Compound DAO. It brings together essential information in a single, easy-to-use source.",

Idea stage: Post the proposal in the \"Proposal\" category on the Compound Forum and provide enough information to demonstrate its impact on Compound.\n2. Community Feedback stage: Use the community's feedback to make any necessary changes to the proposal.\n3. Compound Governor stage: After the proposal is approved by the community and has a high chance of success, it is recommended to move it to an on-chain vote.\n\nAny individual with more than 1% of COMP can propose a proposal to Compound Governance. If they don't have enough COMP, they can request someone else to post the proposal on their behalf. The Compound multisig can also temporarily white-list proposers.\n\n## Compound Improvement Proposals\nThe Compound Improvement Proposals (CIPs) outline the standards, procedures, and upgrades aimed at enhancing the governance protocol. Their objective is to refine both on-chain and off-chain governance of the Compound.\n\nCIPs come in three different forms, each with its distinct methodology, which are detailed below.\n\n1. Meta Process: Any process to be introduced or altered that enhances the coordination of Compound's governance, development, or community initiatives.\n2. Protocol Enhancement: This encompasses any alterations to the smart contracts involved in the Compound Protocol and Governor.\n3. Tooling & Support: This encompasses any new additions or modifications to off-chain infrastructure, tools, documentation, or other supportive components for the use of Compound Protocol.",

CIPs can be drafted as pull requests and then request for a review to be scheduled for discussion at the bi-weekly Working Group meetings.\n\n![](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/compound-eth-1/Guide/compound-governance-compound/cip_appproval_process.png)\n\n\nCIP editors will provide feedback on CIPs. If objections are raised during its first meeting, the CIP must address the feedback and request another review at a future meeting. If there are no objections or a majority of editors support the CIP, it will be approved during its second meeting and remain in the Last Call stage for 14 days before the implementation process commences.\n\n![](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/compound-eth-1/Guide/compound-governance-compound/cip_implementation_process.png)\n\n\nOnce the Working Group approves a CIP, its implementation path will vary based on its type:\n\n1. Meta Process CIPs will be adopted officially through a majority Signal vote by COMP holders without the need for a quorum.\n2. Protocol Enhancements must pass through a Compound Governance vote, just like any other change to the smart contract.\n3. Other CIPs are left to the community to implement, which may include funding approved by a Grant Committee or any other entity willing to support them.\n\nMore Details about CIPs can be found [here](https://github.com/compound-finance/cip-pm/pull/1/files)",

They participate by developing on top of the Compound Protocol or supporting the DAO through grants or partnerships, all while working towards common goals.\n\n\nIn Compound DAO, there are no established working groups, and no templates exist for creating such groups.
