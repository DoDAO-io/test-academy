      "content": "## Extensions\nCompound III, has launched a new feature called \"Extensions\". This feature is designed to allow community developers to create optional add-ons that can be used to enhance the Compound experience for users.\n\nWhen a user enables an extension, it can leverage Compound III's advanced account management functionality to add new features to their account. These can include automation, position management, and composability with other DeFi protocols. Alternatively, an extension can run without requiring any permissions and simply provide useful information like liquidation alerts.\n\n## Extension Types\nThere are two types of extensions: \n1. Web Extensions - Web extensions are like mini-websites that are embedded into the Compound III interface, allowing users to interact with the platform in new and different ways \n2. Operators - Operators, on the other hand, are smart contracts that allow users to do things like move positions from other DeFi platforms to Compound III. \n\nSome extensions have both a web extension and an operator, while others have only one or the other.",

To overcome this limitation, the Web Extension sends a message to the parent window, which then uses the context and forwards the message. `@compound-finance/comet-extension` provides all the glue code needed to interact with the parent window.\n\n```javascript\nlet rpc: RPC = buildRPC();\n\n// Send transaction request\nlet chainId = await sendWeb3(rpc, 'eth_chainId', []);\n\n// Handle incoming messages\nrpc.on({setTheme: ({theme}) => {\n  console.log('theme', theme);\n});\n```\n```javascript\nlet rpc: RPC = buildRPC();\nlet provider = new RPCWeb3Provider(rpc);\n\nprovider.sendTransaction(...);\n```\n\nCompound offers an extension template that includes all the necessary setup code and up-to-date frameworks for creating a frontend application.\n\nhttps://github.com/compound-finance/comet-extension-template\n\nTo create a Comet Web Extension, developers should start by cloning the template repository's boilerplate to their local machine. With Foundry and Vite, they can then develop the Extension's frontend and smart contracts while utilizing a localhost development environment to verify that the code works correctly.",
